Hi,

I’ve read a lot and watch a lot but still no closer to understanding the difference between channels and categories. It may well be a case of not seeing the wood through the trees!

From what I understand the very basic structure goes like this

CHANNEL -> CATEGORY GROUP -> CATEGORIES

If this is wrong, please let me know why. Otherwise let’s assume we have an online magazine

* Articles
** Reviews
** News
** Interviews

* Artists
** Profile

* Videos
** Watch

In my mind, I can’t see where a channel would be used or in other words, I can’t see why I would need more than one channel. Any reason why I wouldn’t have Articles, Artists and Videos as the category groups and their children under them as categories? Where does the channel come into play and would I want to use more than one? Wouldn’t it simply be:

Articles (Category Group)
Artists (Category Group)
Videos (Category Group)

Reviews (Category)
News (Category)
Interviews (Category)
Profile (Category)
Watch (Category)

Why would I want to use more than one channel?

Even thinking about it another way, I can’t see why you would need category groups so for instance I’d have:

Articles (Channel)
Artists (Channel)
Videos (Channel)

Reviews (Category)
News (Category)
Interviews (Category)
Profile (Category)
Watch (Category)

Thanks in advance,

JJ
